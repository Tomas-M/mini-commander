# mini-commander
Mini Commander is very simplified clone of Midnight Commander for Linux.

I would like to call myself an author, but that's not so easy.

The majority of the code, including this text itself, was written by
ChatGPT. The chatbot is not very smart and often makes weird mistakes. It
especially has trouble understanding large amounts of code.

Even with these issues, ChatGPT is still pretty helpful for easy tasks.
If you give it simple instructions one at a time, it can create useful
code. But it's important for you to check the code it makes and fix any
mistakes.

So, even though ChatGPT has some problems, especially with big,
complicated tasks, it can be a big help with smaller, simpler tasks as
long as you double-check the work it does.

ChatGPT don't generate code with an explicit license attached to it. The
code it provides in responses is intended for educational and informational
purposes, and users are free to use it as they see fit. So, the license
of Mini Commander is GNU GPL v3.


Usage:

    make
    ./mc

    # there is no make install
    # copy ./mc to your path if you like
