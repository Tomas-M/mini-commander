The majority of the code, including this text itself, was written by
ChatGPT. The chatbot is not very smart and often makes weird mistakes. It
especially has trouble understanding large amounts of code.

Even with these issues, ChatGPT is still pretty helpful for easy tasks.
If you give it simple instructions one at a time, it can create useful
code. But it's important for you to check the code it makes and fix any
mistakes.

So, even though ChatGPT has some problems, especially with big,
complicated tasks, it can be a big help with smaller, simpler tasks as
long as you double-check the work it does.
